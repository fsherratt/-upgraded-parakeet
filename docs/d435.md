# Realsense D435
> [The D435] uses stereo vision to calculate depth. The D435 is a USB-powered depth camera and consists of a pair of depth sensors, RGB sensor, and infrared projector. It is ideal for makers and developers to add depth perception capability to their prototype.

## Depth calcuation
Intel provide a detailed description of how object depth is calculated from the stereo camera here,
[Depth from Stereo](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/28c404a419ebab98d2ee93615776e8cefb46a340/doc/depth-from-stereo.md).

## Camera Coordinate System
The D435 camera uses the following coordinate system natively. The X-axis points to the right, the positive Y-axis points down, and the positive Z-axis points forward

## Deprojection
Deprojection is the process of converting a depth image into a 3D point cloud. It uses the intrinsics of the camera to achieve this.

#### Camera Intrinsics
The camera intrinsics are,
* **_Fx_** - Focal length in x
* **_Fy_** - Focal length in y
* **_Ppx_** - Principal point in x, usually called the optical center **_cx_**
* **_Ppy_** - Principal point in y, usually called the optical center **_cy_**

All have units of pixels  

This is often presented as a camera projection matrix **_k_**:  
_[ &nbsp;Fx, &nbsp;Skew, &nbsp;Cx ]  
[ &nbsp;0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fy, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cy ]  
[ &nbsp;0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 ]_

Skew is not given by the realsense camera so is taken as zero

#### Deprojection Equations
Using the deprojection equations the equivalent 3D coordinates for each depth_point `z` can be obtained. `i` and `j` are the `x` and `y` depth pixel coordinates. 

`X = z * (i - Ppx) / fx`  
`Y = z * (j - Ppy) / fy`  
`Z = z`
