# Realsense T265
Inside out 6 DOF tracking camera. Uses a combination of SLAM using stereo grayscale cameras and IMU data to provide high frequency 6 DOF data.

## Camera Coordinate Frame
The T265 uses the defacto VR framework standard coordinate system instead of the SDK standard. The positive X direction is towards right imager, the positive Y direction is upwards toward the top of the device, with the zero reference aligned to gravity, and the positive Z direction is inwards toward the back of the device.

## Conversion to Aircraft Reference Coordinate System
For the aircraft to understand the 6DOF data from the camera is much be in the same refence coordinate system. 

The aircraft uses the NED (North, East, Down) coordinate system whereas the T265 uses the system described above.

The T265 may be mounted at a tilted angle _**&alpha;**_. Where _**&alpha;**_ is between 0 and 90 degrees. This must also be taken into account.

### Coordinate Frame Definition
1. The aircraft reference frame `{1}` is specified as FRD (Front Right Down) .
2. The camera reference frame `{2}` is as described
3. The camera body frame `{3}` is given by the output produced from the T265
4. The untilted camera body frame `{4}` is after the tilt angle _**&alpha;**_ has been accounted for
5. The aircraft body frame `{5}` is rigidly attached to the aircraft orientation in the FRD configuration.

All frames axis are coincident to each other, we're just dealing with rotations here

The transforms between frames can be described using homogeneous rotational transforms.

The rotational frame that the aircraft requires is the _**R<sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>**_ frame using the above definitions.

A static rotational transform between frames `{1}` and `{2}`, _**R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>**_,  can be trivially calcualted. The same for frames `{4}` and `{5}`. The relationship between these two homogeneous transforms is _**R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub><sup>T</sup> = R<sup>4</sup><sub>5</sub>**_.

_**R<sup>3</sup><sub>4</sub>**_ is a rotation in x by alpha. The DCM matrix of which is  
_[ 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]  
[ 0, cos &alpha;, -sin &alpha; ]  
[ 0, sin &alpha;,  &nbsp;cos &alpha; ]_

Therefore  
 _**R<sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub> = R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>R<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>R<sup>3</sup><sub>4</sub>R<sup>4</sup><sub>5</sub>**_

 NED coordinates have not yet been taken into account
